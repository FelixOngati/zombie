JAVA CSV file writer
# Problem
 I have users who raise tickets via mail instead of using the
 servicedesk, now I have about 900 tickets as emails, I want to extract the 
 subject of the mails so that I can categorize the tickets accordingly and 
 determine the date they were raised, I am using Zimbra web client for emails 
 so I go ahead and dumb the mails to a folder on my pc.
 You have text files dumped from a mail box, the name of the file
 name of the file contains the subject of the file plus other characters,
 you are required to required to loop through the folder containing the 
 files and extract the email subjects and the date the mail was sent; which
 is basically the created date of the mail, and write the results in a csv file.
 This program does exactly that, without using any external libraries; apart from 
 java inbuilt ones.
 Send me an email on fegati02@gmail.com to get the file dumps.
 Feel free to fork a branch and make improvements.
